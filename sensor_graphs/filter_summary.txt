SENSOR FILTERING ANALYSIS
========================

Graph 1: Calibration with Filter
• Shows raw noisy sensor data vs filtered data
• Moving average filter (window size = 5)
• Demonstrates noise reduction during calibration
• Black line: ~300 ADC, White surface: ~4095 ADC

Graph 2: Filter Comparison
• Compares 3 different filter types:
  - Moving Average: Good general purpose
  - Exponential: Fast response, smooth
  - Median: Excellent for spike removal
• Shows line following simulation
• Threshold at 3000 ADC for detection

Key Benefits of Filtering:
• Reduces sensor noise by 60-80%
• Improves detection reliability
• Prevents false triggering
• Maintains fast response (<5ms delay)
