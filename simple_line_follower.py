"""
A simple, "from-scratch" line-following robot script.

Purpose:
This script provides the most basic, essential logic for a line follower.
It is designed to be easy to understand, debug, and tune. Get this working
first before moving to more complex versions.

How it works:
1.  Captures video from the camera.
2.  Focuses on a specific Region of Interest (ROI) at the bottom of the frame.
3.  Converts the image to black and white (binary thresholding).
4.  Finds the center (centroid) of the white line in the black-and-white image.
5.  Calculates the "error" - how far the line's center is from the center of the view.
6.  Uses a simple Proportional controller (P-controller) to calculate a steering correction.
7.  Sends a speed and turn command to the ESP32 over the network.
8.  Provides clear visual windows to show what the robot is doing, which is
    essential for debugging and tuning the THRESHOLD_VALUE.

# IMPORTANT: Change this to your ESP32's actual IP address

CAM_INDEX = 0  # 0 is usually the default camera. Change if you have multiple cameras.

# Region of Interest (ROI) - Percentage of the screen to focus on.
# We only care about the part of the line directly in front of the robot.
# These values are percentages of the camera height.
ROI_TOP = 0.60    # Start ROI at 60% from the top of the screen.
ROI_HEIGHT = 0.40 # Make the ROI 40% of the screen height.

# Thresholding - This is the MOST IMPORTANT parameter to tune.
# It determines what is considered "line" and what is "floor".
# The image is converted to grayscale (0=black, 255=white). Any pixel
# with a value BELOW this threshold will be considered part of the black line.
# ** HOW TO TUNE **: Look at the "Thresholded View" window. The goal is to
# have the black line appear as a solid white shape, and everything else
# should be black. Adjust this value until you get a clean result.
BLACK_LINE_THRESHOLD = 70

# Proportional-Controller (P-Controller) Gain.
# This single value determines how sharply the robot turns.
# - HIGHER Kp = Sharper, more responsive turns. Too high will cause oscillation.
# - LOWER Kp = Softer, smoother turns. Too low will cause the robot to lose the line on curves.
# ** HOW TO TUNE **: Start with a low value like 0.5. If the robot can't stay on
# the line during curves, increase it. If it wiggles back and forth too much,
# decrease it.
