## üîß Detection System Overview

### Detection Zones

The enhanced system divides the camera view into three intelligent zones:

1. **üéØ Line Detection Zone (Bottom 35%)**
   - Primary line following
   - High-confidence line detection
   - Real-time steering calculations

2. **üîÆ Prediction Zone (Middle 25%)**
   - Corner prediction
   - Upcoming turn detection
   - Smooth trajectory planning

3. **‚ö†Ô∏è Obstacle Detection Zone (Top 40%)**
   - Object detection and classification
   - Threat assessment
   - Avoidance path planning

### Detection Methods

#### 1. YOLO Detection (Optional)
```python
# Automatically detects:
- People, vehicles, animals
- Furniture and objects
- Accurate bounding boxes
- Confidence scores
```

#### 2. Enhanced Contour Detection
```python
# Improved features:
- Bilateral filtering for noise reduction
- Adaptive thresholding for varying light
- Morphological operations for cleanup
- Shape analysis for better filtering
```

#### 3. Motion Detection
```python
# Detects moving obstacles:
- Background subtraction
- Frame differencing
- Moving object tracking
- Dynamic threat assessment
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Parameters

### Obstacle Detection Settings
```python
OBSTACLE_MIN_AREA = 1500          # Minimum obstacle size
OBSTACLE_MIN_WIDTH_RATIO = 0.15   # Minimum width to block path
OBSTACLE_MAX_DISTANCE_RATIO = 0.4 # Maximum distance from center
AVOIDANCE_DURATION = 10           # Frames to perform avoidance
AVOIDANCE_COOLDOWN = 20           # Cooldown between avoidances
```

### Enhanced PID Settings
```python
KP = 0.8    # More responsive proportional gain
KI = 0.03   # Improved integral gain
KD = 0.15   # Enhanced derivative gain
```

### Detection Zones
```python
ZONE_BOTTOM_HEIGHT = 0.35  # Line detection zone
ZONE_MIDDLE_HEIGHT = 0.25  # Prediction zone  
ZONE_TOP_HEIGHT = 0.40     # Obstacle detection zone
```

## üìä Web Dashboard Features

### Enhanced Status Display
- Real-time obstacle count and threat level
- Detection method indicators (YOLO/Enhanced/Motion)
- Avoidance maneuver statistics
- Performance metrics and FPS

### Visual Indicators
- **üü¢ Green**: Normal line following

- **üî¥ Red**: Active threat avoidance
- **‚ö™ Gray**: Line lost/searching

### Detection Method Status
```
YOLO Detection: Available/Fallback Mode
Contour Analysis: Enhanced
Motion Detection: Active
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

### Obstacle Avoidance Logic
1. **Threat Detection**: Identifies objects in robot's path
2. **Direction Decision**: Chooses optimal avoidance direction
3. **Execution**: Performs avoidance maneuver
4. **Cooldown**: Prevents immediate re-triggering
5. **Recovery**: Returns to line following

### False Positive Filtering
- Size and shape validation
- Position relevance checking
- Confidence thresholding
- Duplicate removal

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### YOLO Not Loading
```bash
# Check if YOLO is properly installed
python3 -c "from ultralytics import YOLO; print('YOLO OK')"

# If failed, reinstall:
pip3 install ultralytics torch torchvision
```

#### Too Many False Detections
```python
# Increase confidence thresholds:
OBSTACLE_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.7  # Increase from 0.6
OBSTACLE_MIN_AREA = 2000             # Increase from 1500
```

#### Robot Too Aggressive in Avoidance
```python
# Reduce avoidance sensitivity:
OBSTACLE_MAX_DISTANCE_RATIO = 0.3    # Reduce from 0.4
AVOIDANCE_DURATION = 8               # Reduce from 10
```

#### Poor Line Detection
```python
# Adjust line detection parameters:
BLACK_THRESHOLD = 70                 # Increase from 60
MIN_CONTOUR_AREA = 200              # Increase from 150
```

## üìà Performance Optimization

### For Raspberry Pi 4
- Full YOLO detection enabled
- All enhancement features active
- 15-20 FPS typical performance

### For Raspberry Pi 3B+
- Enhanced contour + motion detection
- Optional YOLO (may reduce FPS)
- 10-15 FPS typical performance

### Memory Usage
- Basic enhanced: ~150MB RAM
- With YOLO: ~300-400MB RAM

## üîÑ Upgrade Path

### From Basic to Enhanced
1. Run the enhanced setup script
2. Update ESP32 IP configuration
3. Test with basic enhancements first
4. Optionally add YOLO detection

### Adding YOLO Later
```bash
# Install YOLO dependencies
pip3 install ultralytics torch torchvision

# Restart the robot script
# YOLO will be automatically detected and enabled
```
